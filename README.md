## components

- Edit post and viewpost and Bloglist components were developed using redux. 
Add component was developed using both redux and context-api.

- Editing, viewing and displaying the bloglist requires global state management so we have used redux. Whereas for adding a post local state management is enough because the data is only used in one component that is the bloglist component.

- Css was used for styling purpose.
